## BpFlac Project

Official Golang implementation of the BpFlac Chain protocol.

This project was forked from the  go-ethereum. And made a lot of changes  to work with wodchain.

And We are working on.

Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch. Binary
archives are published at https://www.wod.ai/download.

## Building the source

Building `gwod` requires Go (version 1.17 or later)  . You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
cd cmd
cd gwod
go build
```



## Executables

The gwod programe is Our main BpFlac Chain CLI client. It is the entry point into the wod network , capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live).  

You can run it as a node to sync and query chain-data for the BpFlac Chain.
 
 

Forgenet connect only import the belivable nodes.To do our  AI transformer work to mine out.

Need at least  8 * A100 to  run as a  POC miner
